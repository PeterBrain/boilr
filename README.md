# Boilr

Water boiler automation with a Fronius pv inverter on a Raspberry Pi.

The objective was to harness the surplus generated by the PV system and enhance daytime self-consumption through water heating. This approach not only reduces the energy fed back to the grid but also curtails the need for heating resources like pellets, oil, or other fuels.

![sufficiency over one day](./docs/sufficiency.jpg)
The yellow area illustrates the self-consumed energy after using Boilr (this program) to increase self-sufficiency. The blue line is the overall energy consumption. The gray region represents the surplus energy directed into the grid. The green line corresponds to the battery charge level, depicted as a percentage, while the green segment represents the surplus energy channeled into the battery.

![self-sufficiency example](./docs/fronius.jpg)
Here, it's evident that all the energy generated by the PV system serves either to charge the battery or for direct consumption (inclusive of electrical devices and the water heater's heating element).

> [!WARNING]
> If dealing with the electrical aspect isn't within your comfort zone, it's advisable to seek assistance from an electrician, as mishandling it can pose serious risks.

## Features

- Heat water with surplus power from PV
- Active date & time spans
- MQTT contactor status
- Operating modes
  - Interactive
  - Daemon
- Manual override

## Setup

### Containerised in Docker (recommended)

1. Build image (on Raspberry Pi)
   - `docker-compose build`
1. Run app in container
   - `docker-compose up -d`

> [!NOTE]
> In order to install and use Docker on a Raspberry Pi 1 Model B, I had to set `sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1` and restart after the installation.

### Manual via cli

1. Install python3
   - `sudo apt install python3 python3-venv`
1. Clone the repo
   - `git clone https://github.com/PeterBrain/boilr.git boilr`
   - `cd boilr`
1. Create a virtual environment & activate it (optional, but recommended)
   - `python3 -m venv venv`
   - `source venv/bin/activate`
1. Install all requirements
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. ~~Create boilr folder in /var/log~~
   - ~~`mkdir /var/log/boilr`~~ Boilr will do that for you (needs elevated rights)
1. Edit the config file to your needs
   - `vi config.yaml`

## Usage

Starting:

```bash
python3 -m boilr start
```

Stopping:

```bash
python3 -m boilr stop
```

Others:

```bash
python3 -m boilr [-h] [-v] {start,stop,status,restart,run,manual {0,1}}
```

Complete guide (boilr -h):

```bash
usage: boilr [-h] [-v] {start,stop,status,restart,run,manual} ...

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         increase verbosity (default: False)

commands:
  Choose between the following positional arguments

  {start,stop,status,restart,run,manual}
    start               Start boilr service
    stop                Stop boilr service
    status              Show the status of boilr service
    restart             Restart boilr service
    run                 Start boilr in command-line
    manual              Manually override contactor

Additional hardware required. Please check:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In all operating modes Boilr needs permission to create a file in /var/log. If you run boilr as a daemon it needs permission to create a file in /var/run. Pytest needs write permission to /var/log too.

## Requirements

### Software

- Raspberry Pi with operating system (for me it is model 1B with headless Raspbian)
- Python 3 (tested with 3.10)
- some python packages
- Docker (optional, but recommended)
- MQTT Broker (optional, but recommended)

### Hardware

Here is a list of all parts I used (2020):

- Contactor to switch the three phases AC (~20€)
- 5x1.5mm2 copper stranded cable (~10€)
  - Ferrules (for stranded wires)
- circuit breaker (I had one available, but it would cost around 20€)
- Distribution box (~20€)
- Raspberry Pi 1B (used for about 5€) + an sd card for the os
- Relay for the pi (5pcs for 8€, only one necessary)
- Ethernet cable (I had an old one at home (Cat5 - not even Cat5e))
- Network switch (used, gigabit (overkill) around 5-10€, or an old router with a builtin switch for free)
- Fronius PV inverter
  - Battery is optional

Regarding the second Schuko socket, I made an oversight and didn't consider the distribution box lid. Unfortunately, the lid cannot be closed when there's something plugged into the Schuko socket on the hut rail.

## Weaknesses

The existing design exhibits a significant limitation: in contrast to Ohmpilot[^1], a comparable Fronius product that boasts notably higher efficiency due to its use of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), my setup operates solely in two states. It's either fully activated, providing maximum power to the heating coil, or completely deactivated. The optimal efficiency advantage is sacrificed on days when PV production falls just short of meeting both the household's current consumption and the water heating requirements.
